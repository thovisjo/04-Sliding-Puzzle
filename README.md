This is a 15-tile game mixed with a word game. I wanted to make something unique that could be improved upon and possibly made into a game for sale in the future.
The code all works but it feels like it could be vastly improved. I edited the square code to better fit my needs, so the spaces I included in the three letter words would be the invisible space. As far as I can tell, the puzzle is always solveable, as there is significantly more freedom in where the words and letters can go, compared to how in most 15 puzzles they need to be in an exact order. I hope to continue working on this one, as I feel I could release it for real.

HOW TO PLAY:
The goal of the game is to arrange the letters in a 3 character word and three 4 character words. If the characters are in the right column, they turn green. If not, they are red. The entire board can be green and yet the game still not won, as the green just shows whether that character can be in that column. It also records turns taken on the right side. Once the player gets all the words, the right side will exclaim YOU WIN and the player will no longer be able to interact with the blocks. Some improvements could be made, more words added and eventually I want to track words made that arent the words the puzzle chose. 

I was going to make the tiles look like wood, but my knowledge of pygame was a little too limited and my googling skills failed me.
